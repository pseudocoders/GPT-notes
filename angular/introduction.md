# Introduction

Angular is a popular web development framework created by Google that has evolved significantly since its initial release. It originally started as AngularJS, also known as Angular 1.x, and later underwent a complete rewrite to become Angular, commonly referred to as Angular 2 and onwards.

AngularJS was released in 2010 and quickly gained popularity among web developers. It introduced the concept of two-way data binding, which allowed seamless synchronization of data between the model and the view. AngularJS also provided a powerful templating system, dependency injection, and a modular structure for building complex web applications.

However, as web development evolved and new requirements emerged, the team behind Angular recognized the need for a more efficient and scalable framework. This led to a complete rewrite, resulting in Angular, which was released in 2016 as Angular 2.

Angular introduced several significant changes and improvements over AngularJS. The framework was redesigned to take advantage of modern web development practices, such as component-based architecture and a reactive programming approach. It embraced TypeScript as its primary language, providing developers with static typing, enhanced tooling, and improved code organization.

One of the major changes in Angular was the shift from two-way data binding to a unidirectional data flow. This means that data flows in a single direction, from the component to the view, simplifying the debugging and understanding of application behavior.

Additionally, Angular introduced a modular structure based on Angular Modules, which allow developers to organize their application into reusable and self-contained units. Dependency injection remained a core feature of Angular, making it easier to manage and test dependencies within the application.

Angular also emphasized performance optimizations, including ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, lazy loading of modules, and tree shaking. These techniques improved the loading speed and overall performance of Angular applications.

Since its release, Angular has continued to evolve with regular updates and new features. The Angular team has focused on improving developer productivity, enhancing the performance of the framework, and providing a comprehensive ecosystem of tools and libraries.

In conclusion, Angular has come a long way from its predecessor, AngularJS. The transition from AngularJS to Angular marked a significant shift in terms of architecture, language choice, and development practices. Angular has become a powerful framework for building scalable, high-performance web applications, empowering developers to create modern and engaging user experiences.
