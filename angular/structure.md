# Structure of an Angular project

The structure of an Angular project typically follows a modular and component-based approach. Here's an overview of the common directories and files you'll find in an Angular project:

1. `src/`: This is the main directory where your application's source code resides.
   - `app/`: Contains the main components, modules, services, and other Angular-specific files.
     - `app.component.ts`, `app.component.html`, `app.component.css`: The root component files that define the main application view and logic.
     - `app.module.ts`: The root module file that orchestrates the application by importing and configuring other modules.
   - `assets/`: Holds static assets like images, fonts, and other files used by the application.
   - `environments/`: Contains environment-specific configuration files.
     - `environment.ts`, `environment.prod.ts`: Configuration files for development and production environments, respectively.

2. `angular.json`: The Angular project configuration file that defines various settings and build options.

3. `tsconfig.json`: The TypeScript configuration file that specifies compiler options for the project.

4. `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the Angular application.

5. `styles.css`: The global CSS file that applies styles to the entire application.

6. `main.ts`: The entry point for the Angular application, where the application module is bootstrapped.

7. `polyfills.ts`: A file that includes polyfills to provide compatibility with older browsers.

8. `test.ts`: The entry point for running tests in the project.

9. `karma.conf.js` and `protractor.conf.js`: Configuration files for running unit tests and end-to-end tests, respectively.

Additionally, as you create components, services, modules, and other Angular artifacts, you'll find that each of them usually has its own directory within the `app/` directory. This helps to maintain a modular structure and keeps related files together.

For example, a component might have the following structure:
- `component-name/`
  - `component-name.component.ts`: The TypeScript file defining the component's logic.
  - `component-name.component.html`: The HTML template file for the component's view.
  - `component-name.component.css`: The CSS file for styling the component.

Similarly, modules, services, and other Angular constructs follow a similar directory structure within the `app/` directory.

It's important to note that while this is a common structure for an Angular project, it can be customized based on the project's specific requirements.

## tsconfig.json

The `tsconfig.json` file is a configuration file used by the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to specify various options and settings for the TypeScript project. It resides in the root directory of an Angular project and allows you to customize the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. Here's a breakdown of the key properties you'll find in a typical `tsconfig.json` file:

1. `compilerOptions`: This section defines the compiler options for the TypeScript project. Some commonly used properties include:

   - `target`: Specifies the ECMAScript target version for the compiled JavaScript. For Angular projects, the recommended value is usually `"es2015"` or higher.
   - `module`: Determines the module code generation. `"es2020"` or `"esNext"` is commonly used for Angular projects.
   - `outDir`: Specifies the output directory for compiled JavaScript files.
   - `strict`: Enables strict type-checking options.
   - `esModuleInterop`: Allows the use of CommonJS modules with default imports and exports.
   - `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`: Allows default imports from modules with no default export.
   - `sourceMap`: Generates source map files for easier debugging.
   - `angularCompilerOptions`: Additional configuration options specific to Angular projects. This is an optional property.

2. `include` and `exclude`: These properties determine which files are included or excluded from compilation. By default, the `include` property is set to include all TypeScript files (`"src/**/*.ts"`), while the `exclude` property excludes certain directories (`"node_modules"`, `"**/*.spec.ts"`, etc.).

3. `files`: This property allows you to explicitly list the files to be included in the project. If present, it overrides the `include` and `exclude` properties.

4. `references`: This property is used in project references, which allow you to split your TypeScript project into smaller subprojects that can depend on each other.

5. `angularCompilerOptions` (optional): This property includes additional configuration options specific to the Angular Compiler. Some commonly used properties include:

   - `strictTemplates`: Enables stricter template type-checking.
   - `enableIvy`: Enables the Angular Ivy compiler. This is the default value for Angular projects generated with Angular CLI.

These are just a few examples of the properties you can configure in the `tsconfig.json` file. There are many more options available to customize the TypeScript compiler behavior and tailor it to your project's specific requirements.

It's worth noting that the `tsconfig.json` file can also support extending other configuration files, such as a base configuration or additional environment-specific configurations, using the `extends` property. This allows you to reuse and inherit settings from other configuration files, making it easier to maintain and share configuration across different projects.

## angular.json


The `angular.json` file is a configuration file used by Angular CLI to define various settings and options for an Angular project. It resides in the root directory of an Angular project and is responsible for managing the build, serve, and test configurations. Let's dive deeper into the structure and key properties of the `angular.json` file:

1. `version`: Specifies the Angular CLI version used to generate the configuration file.

2. `newProjectRoot`: Specifies the root directory for new projects created within the workspace.

3. `projects`: This section contains configurations for individual projects within the workspace. By default, it includes a configuration for the main project with the name `"project-name"`. Inside each project configuration, you'll find the following properties:

   - `root`: Specifies the root directory for the project.
   - `sourceRoot`: Specifies the root directory for the project's source files (by default, `"src"`).
   - `projectType`: Indicates the project type (`"application"` for an Angular application or `"library"` for an Angular library).
   - `architect`: This section contains configurations for various architectural aspects of the project, such as building, serving, testing, etc. The key properties within the `architect` section include:

     - `build`: Specifies the configuration for building the project, including options for AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation, output paths, file replacements, etc.
     - `serve`: Configures the development server options, including the port, proxy configurations, etc.
     - `test`: Defines the configuration for running tests using different test frameworks (Karma, Jest, etc.) and provides options like code coverage, reporters, etc.
     - `lint`: Configures the linting options for the project, including which files to lint, linting rules, etc.
     - `e2e`: Specifies the configuration for end-to-end (e2e) tests using tools like Protractor, including options for test scripts, server configurations, etc.

4. `defaultProject`: Specifies the default project to use for commands when a project name is not provided explicitly.

5. `schematics`: This section allows you to customize Angular CLI's schematics, which are used for generating components, modules, services, etc. You can specify custom schematics collections and aliases in this section.

6. `cli`: Configurations related to the Angular CLI itself, such as the default schematics collection, package manager, etc.

The `angular.json` file provides a centralized place to configure various aspects of an Angular project, including build, serve, test, and other project-specific settings. It allows you to customize your project's architecture and behavior according to your specific requirements and preferences.

It's worth noting that when you make changes to the `angular.json` file, you may need to restart the Angular CLI commands for the changes to take effect.

## The modular structure of Angular projects

The modular structure is an essential aspect of organizing and maintaining Angular projects effectively. It involves breaking down the application into smaller, reusable, and independent modules, each responsible for a specific set of features or functionalities. The modular structure in Angular provides several benefits, such as code separation, easier maintenance, improved scalability, and better collaboration among developers. Here's a typical modular structure of an Angular project:

1. **App Module (`app.module.ts`):** The root module of the application, responsible for bootstrapping the application and importing other feature modules. It usually contains the main `AppComponent` and coordinates the overall functionality of the app.

2. **Feature Modules:** These modules represent different parts or features of the application. They encapsulate related components, services, directives, and pipes into cohesive units. Feature modules are typically organized based on the different sections of the application, such as user dashboard, admin panel, settings, etc.

   - **Example:** `user.module.ts`, `admin.module.ts`, `settings.module.ts`, etc.

3. **Shared Module (`shared.module.ts`):** This module contains reusable components, directives, pipes, and services that are shared across different feature modules. It helps avoid code duplication and promotes consistency throughout the application.

4. **Core Module (`core.module.ts`):** The core module contains singleton services, global configurations, and components that are essential to the application's core functionality. It's loaded only once and shared throughout the app, typically at the root level.

5. **Routing Module (`app-routing.module.ts`):** The routing module handles the application's navigation and defines the routes for different components and feature modules. It imports all the feature modules' routing modules and provides a clean way to manage navigation.

6. **Components, Directives, and Pipes:** These are typically organized within their respective feature modules or the shared module. Keeping components and other artifacts within their respective modules improves encapsulation and reusability.

7. **Services:** Services should be placed within their respective feature modules or in the core module, depending on their scope. Shared services should go in the core module to ensure singleton behavior and avoid duplicating instances.

8. **Assets:** This directory contains static assets such as images, styles, and fonts used in the application.

9. **Environments:** The environments folder contains configuration files for different environments (e.g., development, production). It allows you to define environment-specific variables and settings.

10. **Configuration Files:** The root directory contains various configuration files such as `angular.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `package.json`, which define project settings and dependencies.

11. **App Component (`app.component.ts`):** The main component of the application that acts as the root component. It holds the layout and template for the entire application.

By following a modular structure, Angular projects become more organized, maintainable, and scalable. Developers can work on specific features independently without interfering with other parts of the application. This modular approach is especially beneficial in larger applications or when multiple developers are collaborating on the same project.

### Reusable user modules

To generate a reusable module with an Angular component and service that can be used in another Angular app, follow these steps:

Step 1: Create a New Angular Module
First, create a new Angular module that will contain the component and service. In this example, let's call the module `shared-module`.

Run the following Angular CLI command to generate the module:
```bash
ng generate module shared-module
```

Step 2: Generate a Component and a Service
Next, generate an Angular component and service inside the `shared-module`. Let's name them `shared-component` and `shared-service`, respectively.

Generate the component:
```bash
ng generate component shared-module/shared-component
```

Generate the service:
```bash
ng generate service shared-module/shared-service
```

Step 3: Implement the Component and Service
Edit the `shared-component` and `shared-service` to implement the desired functionality. For example:

shared-component.component.ts:
```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-shared-component',
  templateUrl: './shared-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./shared-component.component.css']
})
export class SharedComponentComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
  }

  // Add component logic here
}
```

shared-service.service.ts:
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class SharedServiceService {

  constructor() { }

  // Add service logic here
}
```

Step 4: Export the Component and Service
In the `shared-module`, you need to export the `SharedComponentComponent` and `SharedServiceService` so that other apps can import and use them.

shared-module.module.ts:
```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { SharedComponentComponent } from './shared-component/shared-component.component';
import { SharedServiceService } from './shared-service/shared-service.service';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [SharedComponentComponent],
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  exports: [SharedComponentComponent], // Export the component
  providers: [SharedServiceService] // Export the service
})
export class SharedModule { }
```

Step 5: Build and Publish the Shared Module
To make the `shared-module` available for reuse, you need to build and publish it as a library. Angular provides the Angular Package Format (APF) to build libraries.

Run the following Angular CLI command to build the library:
```bash
ng build shared-module
```

This command will create a `dist/shared-module` folder with the library artifacts.

Step 6: Use the Shared Module in Another Angular App
To use the `shared-module` in another Angular app, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `dist/shared-module` folder from the previous step and paste it into the `node_modules` folder of your target Angular app.

2. Import the `SharedModule` in the target app's module where you want to use the shared component and service.

app.module.ts:
```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { SharedModule } from 'shared-module'; // Import the SharedModule

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    SharedModule // Add SharedModule to imports
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

3. Now you can use the `SharedComponentComponent` and `SharedServiceService` in your target app's components and services.

That's it! You have successfully generated a reusable Angular module with a component and service and used it in another Angular app. This modular approach allows you to share common functionality across multiple Angular applications, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

## app.module.ts

The `app.module.ts` file in an Angular project is a crucial file that serves as the root module of the application. It is responsible for importing and configuring various modules, components, services, and other dependencies required for the proper functioning of the application. Here's an explanation of the typical structure of the `app.module.ts` file in an Angular project:

1. Import Statements: The `app.module.ts` file begins with a series of import statements. These imports include Angular modules, third-party libraries, components, services, and other dependencies required for the application.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';

// Other imports as needed
```

2. `@NgModule` Decorator: The `@NgModule` decorator is used to define the metadata for the module. It includes various properties that specify the declarations, imports, providers, bootstrap components, and other configurations for the module.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    // List of components, directives, and pipes declared in this module
  ],
  imports: [
    // List of modules imported in this module
  ],
  providers: [
    // List of services/providers used by this module
  ],
  bootstrap: [
    // List of components that serve as the root component for the application
  ]
})
```

3. Declarations: The `declarations` property inside the `@NgModule` decorator contains an array of components, directives, and pipes that belong to the current module. These components, directives, and pipes are available for use within the module.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    HomeComponent,
    MyComponent,
    CustomDirective,
    CustomPipe
  ],
  // Other properties...
})
```

4. Imports: The `imports` property inside the `@NgModule` decorator lists other modules that are imported into the current module. These modules provide various functionalities and features to the application.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpClientModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    // Other imported modules...
  ],
  // Other properties...
})
```

5. Providers: The `providers` property inside the `@NgModule` decorator is used to specify the services or providers that are available for injection and use within the module and its components.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  providers: [
    DataService,
    AuthService,
    // Other services/providers...
  ],
  // Other properties...
})
```

6. Bootstrap: The `bootstrap` property inside the `@NgModule` decorator is an array of components that will be bootstrapped when the application starts. Typically, this array contains the root component of the application, usually named `AppComponent`.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  bootstrap: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  // Other properties...
})
```

7. Exporting the Module: Finally, the module is exported using the `export` keyword so that it can be imported and used by other modules if needed.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  // Module configurations...
})
export class AppModule { }
```

The `app.module.ts` file provides the foundation for the Angular application, defining its structure, dependencies, and configuration. Additional modules can be created to organize the application further, but the root module (`AppModule`) remains the entry point of the application.

## Bootstraping

The bootstrap process in an Angular application refers to the initialization and startup sequence of the Angular framework. During the bootstrap process, Angular initializes the necessary components, modules, services, and sets up the application's runtime environment. Let's dive into the details of the bootstrap process in an Angular application:

1. Entry Point: The bootstrap process starts from the entry point file, typically `main.ts`, located in the `src/` directory of your Angular project.

2. Imports and Dependencies: In `main.ts`, you'll find various import statements for Angular dependencies and modules required for bootstrapping the application. These imports usually include `platformBrowserDynamic` from `@angular/platform-browser-dynamic`, which is responsible for dynamically bootstrapping the Angular application.

3. Bootstrap Function: Angular provides a `bootstrap` function that is called to bootstrap the application. It takes two arguments:
   - The root module of the application, typically referred to as the AppModule.
   - An optional configuration object that allows you to specify additional settings.

4. AppModule: The AppModule is a core module that orchestrates and defines the structure of your application. It is typically defined in a file named `app.module.ts`, located in the `src/app/` directory. The AppModule imports other modules, declares components, provides services, and configures application-wide settings.

5. Module Resolution: When the `bootstrap` function is called with the AppModule, Angular resolves the dependencies of the module and performs a recursive process to resolve the dependencies of all imported modules. This ensures that all required modules and components are available during the bootstrap process.

6. Component Hierarchy: Angular identifies the root component of the application defined within the AppModule. This root component is usually referred to as AppComponent. It serves as the entry point for the application's user interface and contains other components, forming a hierarchy.

7. Compilation and Compilation Context: Angular compiles the component templates, stylesheets, and TypeScript code into executable JavaScript. It creates a compilation context for the application, which is responsible for rendering and updating the application's views.

8. Dependency Injection: Angular performs dependency injection for all required services, injecting instances into the components and other parts of the application as defined in the AppModule and their respective providers.

9. Component Initialization: Angular initializes the root component (AppComponent) and its child components in a top-down manner. During the initialization process, Angular sets up component instances, binds data, and connects event handlers.

10. Rendering: Angular renders the application's views based on the component hierarchy and the initial data state. It creates the necessary DOM elements, applies styles, and sets up event listeners.

11. Application Lifecycle: Once the bootstrap process is completed, the Angular application enters the lifecycle phase. It can respond to user interactions, handle data changes, and update the view accordingly.

By understanding the bootstrap process, you gain insight into how Angular initializes and sets up your application. It's important to note that Angular's bootstrapping process is automatic, and you generally don't need to modify it unless you have specific customization requirements or need to integrate with external systems.

##  Lifecycle of a component 

In a routed Angular application, the lifecycle of a component includes various stages and events that occur as the component is created, rendered, updated, and destroyed. The lifecycle hooks provided by Angular allow you to tap into these stages and execute custom logic. Let's explore the detailed lifecycle of a component in a routed Angular application:

1. Creation Stage:
   - `constructor()`: The component's constructor is called first when the component is instantiated. This is where you initialize component properties and dependencies.

   - `ngOnChanges()`: If the component has input properties, this hook is called when the inputs change. It receives a `SimpleChanges` object containing the previous and current values of the input properties.

   - `ngOnInit()`: This hook is called once after the component's constructor and `ngOnChanges()` have been called. It is commonly used to perform initialization tasks like fetching data from a server or initializing component state.

2. Rendering Stage:
   - `ngDoCheck()`: This hook is called during every change detection cycle. It allows you to perform custom change detection and react to changes in component properties or its child components.

   - `ngAfterContentInit()`: This hook is called after Angular projects external content into the component's view, such as projected content from a parent component or dynamic component creation.

   - `ngAfterContentChecked()`: This hook is called after every change detection cycle when Angular has checked the projected content within the component's view.

   - `ngAfterViewInit()`: This hook is called after Angular initializes the component's view and child views. It is commonly used for DOM manipulations or interacting with child components.

   - `ngAfterViewChecked()`: This hook is called after every change detection cycle when Angular has checked the component's view and child views.

3. Update Stage:
   - `ngOnChanges()`: If any input properties change after the initial rendering, the `ngOnChanges()` hook is called again.

   - `ngDoCheck()`: This hook is called during every change detection cycle, allowing you to perform additional change detection and react to any updates.

4. Destruction Stage:
   - `ngOnDestroy()`: This hook is called just before the component is destroyed. It provides an opportunity to clean up resources, such as unsubscribing from observables or releasing event listeners.

Each lifecycle hook serves a specific purpose and provides a way to tap into different stages of a component's lifecycle. By implementing these hooks in your component, you can perform tasks like initialization, data updates, rendering adjustments, and cleanup operations.

It's important to note that when navigating between routes in an Angular application, components might be destroyed and re-created depending on the routing configuration. Therefore, understanding the component lifecycle is essential for managing component state, data fetching, and resource cleanup in a routed Angular application.
