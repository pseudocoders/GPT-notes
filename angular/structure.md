# Structure of an Angular project

The structure of an Angular project typically follows a modular and component-based approach. Here's an overview of the common directories and files you'll find in an Angular project:

1. `src/`: This is the main directory where your application's source code resides.
   - `app/`: Contains the main components, modules, services, and other Angular-specific files.
     - `app.component.ts`, `app.component.html`, `app.component.css`: The root component files that define the main application view and logic.
     - `app.module.ts`: The root module file that orchestrates the application by importing and configuring other modules.
   - `assets/`: Holds static assets like images, fonts, and other files used by the application.
   - `environments/`: Contains environment-specific configuration files.
     - `environment.ts`, `environment.prod.ts`: Configuration files for development and production environments, respectively.

2. `angular.json`: The Angular project configuration file that defines various settings and build options.

3. `tsconfig.json`: The TypeScript configuration file that specifies compiler options for the project.

4. `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the Angular application.

5. `styles.css`: The global CSS file that applies styles to the entire application.

6. `main.ts`: The entry point for the Angular application, where the application module is bootstrapped.

7. `polyfills.ts`: A file that includes polyfills to provide compatibility with older browsers.

8. `test.ts`: The entry point for running tests in the project.

9. `karma.conf.js` and `protractor.conf.js`: Configuration files for running unit tests and end-to-end tests, respectively.

Additionally, as you create components, services, modules, and other Angular artifacts, you'll find that each of them usually has its own directory within the `app/` directory. This helps to maintain a modular structure and keeps related files together.

For example, a component might have the following structure:
- `component-name/`
  - `component-name.component.ts`: The TypeScript file defining the component's logic.
  - `component-name.component.html`: The HTML template file for the component's view.
  - `component-name.component.css`: The CSS file for styling the component.

Similarly, modules, services, and other Angular constructs follow a similar directory structure within the `app/` directory.

It's important to note that while this is a common structure for an Angular project, it can be customized based on the project's specific requirements.

## tsconfig.json

The `tsconfig.json` file is a configuration file used by the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to specify various options and settings for the TypeScript project. It resides in the root directory of an Angular project and allows you to customize the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. Here's a breakdown of the key properties you'll find in a typical `tsconfig.json` file:

1. `compilerOptions`: This section defines the compiler options for the TypeScript project. Some commonly used properties include:

   - `target`: Specifies the ECMAScript target version for the compiled JavaScript. For Angular projects, the recommended value is usually `"es2015"` or higher.
   - `module`: Determines the module code generation. `"es2020"` or `"esNext"` is commonly used for Angular projects.
   - `outDir`: Specifies the output directory for compiled JavaScript files.
   - `strict`: Enables strict type-checking options.
   - `esModuleInterop`: Allows the use of CommonJS modules with default imports and exports.
   - `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`: Allows default imports from modules with no default export.
   - `sourceMap`: Generates source map files for easier debugging.
   - `angularCompilerOptions`: Additional configuration options specific to Angular projects. This is an optional property.

2. `include` and `exclude`: These properties determine which files are included or excluded from compilation. By default, the `include` property is set to include all TypeScript files (`"src/**/*.ts"`), while the `exclude` property excludes certain directories (`"node_modules"`, `"**/*.spec.ts"`, etc.).

3. `files`: This property allows you to explicitly list the files to be included in the project. If present, it overrides the `include` and `exclude` properties.

4. `references`: This property is used in project references, which allow you to split your TypeScript project into smaller subprojects that can depend on each other.

5. `angularCompilerOptions` (optional): This property includes additional configuration options specific to the Angular Compiler. Some commonly used properties include:

   - `strictTemplates`: Enables stricter template type-checking.
   - `enableIvy`: Enables the Angular Ivy compiler. This is the default value for Angular projects generated with Angular CLI.

These are just a few examples of the properties you can configure in the `tsconfig.json` file. There are many more options available to customize the TypeScript compiler behavior and tailor it to your project's specific requirements.

It's worth noting that the `tsconfig.json` file can also support extending other configuration files, such as a base configuration or additional environment-specific configurations, using the `extends` property. This allows you to reuse and inherit settings from other configuration files, making it easier to maintain and share configuration across different projects.

## angular.json


The `angular.json` file is a configuration file used by Angular CLI to define various settings and options for an Angular project. It resides in the root directory of an Angular project and is responsible for managing the build, serve, and test configurations. Let's dive deeper into the structure and key properties of the `angular.json` file:

1. `version`: Specifies the Angular CLI version used to generate the configuration file.

2. `newProjectRoot`: Specifies the root directory for new projects created within the workspace.

3. `projects`: This section contains configurations for individual projects within the workspace. By default, it includes a configuration for the main project with the name `"project-name"`. Inside each project configuration, you'll find the following properties:

   - `root`: Specifies the root directory for the project.
   - `sourceRoot`: Specifies the root directory for the project's source files (by default, `"src"`).
   - `projectType`: Indicates the project type (`"application"` for an Angular application or `"library"` for an Angular library).
   - `architect`: This section contains configurations for various architectural aspects of the project, such as building, serving, testing, etc. The key properties within the `architect` section include:

     - `build`: Specifies the configuration for building the project, including options for AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation, output paths, file replacements, etc.
     - `serve`: Configures the development server options, including the port, proxy configurations, etc.
     - `test`: Defines the configuration for running tests using different test frameworks (Karma, Jest, etc.) and provides options like code coverage, reporters, etc.
     - `lint`: Configures the linting options for the project, including which files to lint, linting rules, etc.
     - `e2e`: Specifies the configuration for end-to-end (e2e) tests using tools like Protractor, including options for test scripts, server configurations, etc.

4. `defaultProject`: Specifies the default project to use for commands when a project name is not provided explicitly.

5. `schematics`: This section allows you to customize Angular CLI's schematics, which are used for generating components, modules, services, etc. You can specify custom schematics collections and aliases in this section.

6. `cli`: Configurations related to the Angular CLI itself, such as the default schematics collection, package manager, etc.

The `angular.json` file provides a centralized place to configure various aspects of an Angular project, including build, serve, test, and other project-specific settings. It allows you to customize your project's architecture and behavior according to your specific requirements and preferences.

It's worth noting that when you make changes to the `angular.json` file, you may need to restart the Angular CLI commands for the changes to take effect.

## Bootstraping

The bootstrap process in an Angular application refers to the initialization and startup sequence of the Angular framework. During the bootstrap process, Angular initializes the necessary components, modules, services, and sets up the application's runtime environment. Let's dive into the details of the bootstrap process in an Angular application:

1. Entry Point: The bootstrap process starts from the entry point file, typically `main.ts`, located in the `src/` directory of your Angular project.

2. Imports and Dependencies: In `main.ts`, you'll find various import statements for Angular dependencies and modules required for bootstrapping the application. These imports usually include `platformBrowserDynamic` from `@angular/platform-browser-dynamic`, which is responsible for dynamically bootstrapping the Angular application.

3. Bootstrap Function: Angular provides a `bootstrap` function that is called to bootstrap the application. It takes two arguments:
   - The root module of the application, typically referred to as the AppModule.
   - An optional configuration object that allows you to specify additional settings.

4. AppModule: The AppModule is a core module that orchestrates and defines the structure of your application. It is typically defined in a file named `app.module.ts`, located in the `src/app/` directory. The AppModule imports other modules, declares components, provides services, and configures application-wide settings.

5. Module Resolution: When the `bootstrap` function is called with the AppModule, Angular resolves the dependencies of the module and performs a recursive process to resolve the dependencies of all imported modules. This ensures that all required modules and components are available during the bootstrap process.

6. Component Hierarchy: Angular identifies the root component of the application defined within the AppModule. This root component is usually referred to as AppComponent. It serves as the entry point for the application's user interface and contains other components, forming a hierarchy.

7. Compilation and Compilation Context: Angular compiles the component templates, stylesheets, and TypeScript code into executable JavaScript. It creates a compilation context for the application, which is responsible for rendering and updating the application's views.

8. Dependency Injection: Angular performs dependency injection for all required services, injecting instances into the components and other parts of the application as defined in the AppModule and their respective providers.

9. Component Initialization: Angular initializes the root component (AppComponent) and its child components in a top-down manner. During the initialization process, Angular sets up component instances, binds data, and connects event handlers.

10. Rendering: Angular renders the application's views based on the component hierarchy and the initial data state. It creates the necessary DOM elements, applies styles, and sets up event listeners.

11. Application Lifecycle: Once the bootstrap process is completed, the Angular application enters the lifecycle phase. It can respond to user interactions, handle data changes, and update the view accordingly.

By understanding the bootstrap process, you gain insight into how Angular initializes and sets up your application. It's important to note that Angular's bootstrapping process is automatic, and you generally don't need to modify it unless you have specific customization requirements or need to integrate with external systems.
