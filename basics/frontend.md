## Libraries vs frameworks

The main differences between a frontend library and a framework are as follows:

1. **Granularity**: Libraries are generally smaller and more focused on specific tasks or features. They provide a set of functions, utilities, or components that can be used to enhance the development process. Libraries tend to be more flexible and allow developers to pick and choose which parts they want to use in their project.

   Frameworks, on the other hand, are more comprehensive and provide a complete structure for building applications. They offer a set of predefined patterns, rules, and conventions to follow. Frameworks dictate the overall architecture and control flow of the application, providing guidelines for how different components should interact.

2. **Control**: Libraries give developers more control over the application's flow and architecture. Developers can choose which libraries to include, where to use them, and how to structure their code. Libraries tend to be less opinionated and allow for more freedom in decision-making.

   Frameworks, on the other hand, exert more control over the application. They provide a higher level of abstraction and define the application's architecture, data flow, and component interactions. Frameworks often follow specific conventions and may require developers to adhere to their prescribed patterns and practices.

3. **Learning Curve**: Libraries typically have a smaller learning curve since they focus on specific tasks or features. Developers can quickly understand and start using individual libraries within their projects.

   Frameworks often have a steeper learning curve because they encompass the entire application structure. Developers need to understand the framework's concepts, conventions, and workflows to effectively use it. Frameworks may require more time and effort to learn and master.

4. **Flexibility**: Libraries offer greater flexibility as developers can choose which libraries to include and integrate into their projects. They can be easily added or removed, allowing for a more modular approach to development.

   Frameworks provide a more opinionated and integrated approach. They offer a predefined structure and architecture, which can limit flexibility but also provide a solid foundation for building complex applications. Developers may need to adhere to the framework's guidelines and adapt their code to fit within its structure.

In summary, libraries are smaller, focused tools that enhance specific functionalities, while frameworks provide a comprehensive structure and dictate the overall architecture of an application. Libraries offer more flexibility and control, whereas frameworks provide a more opinionated and integrated approach. The choice between using a library or a framework depends on the project's requirements, the developer's preferences, and the desired level of control and structure.

### Opinionated frameworks

In the context of a framework, "opinionated" refers to the strong conventions, rules, and preferences that the framework imposes on developers. An opinionated framework has a specific and defined way of doing things, and it guides developers to follow those established patterns.

Here are some key characteristics of an opinionated framework:

1. **Prescribed architecture**: An opinionated framework typically enforces a specific architectural pattern, such as MVC (Model-View-Controller) or MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). It outlines how components should be structured, how data flows between them, and where business logic should reside.

2. **Conventions over configuration**: Opinionated frameworks rely on predefined conventions rather than allowing extensive configuration options. They encourage developers to follow established naming conventions, file structure, and code organization. This approach reduces decision-making overhead and promotes consistency across projects.

3. **Standardized tooling**: Opinionated frameworks often come with a set of recommended tools, libraries, and build processes. They provide a predefined stack or ecosystem that works well together. This helps maintain consistency and ensures that developers have a common set of tools to work with.

4. **Limited flexibility**: Opinionated frameworks prioritize convention and consistency over flexibility. They make certain assumptions about the development workflow and may restrict certain customization options. Developers using an opinionated framework are expected to adhere to its prescribed practices and guidelines.

5. **Rapid development**: Opinionated frameworks aim to streamline the development process by providing a clear and efficient path to building applications. By enforcing conventions and providing predefined solutions, they reduce the need for making numerous decisions and speed up the development cycle.

Opinionated frameworks have the advantage of providing a well-defined structure and reducing the cognitive load of developers. They can be particularly useful for beginners or teams that prefer a more guided approach to development. However, they may not be suitable for projects with specific requirements that deviate significantly from the framework's opinions, as they might impose constraints or limitations that hinder customization.

In contrast, "unopinionated" or "flexible" frameworks provide fewer restrictions and offer more freedom for developers to make their own choices regarding architecture, tools, and conventions. They allow developers to make decisions based on their specific project needs and preferences.
