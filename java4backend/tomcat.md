## Enterprise application server

Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition) server, also referred to as an application server or enterprise application server, is a software platform that implements the Java EE specifications. It provides a runtime environment and a comprehensive set of services for developing, deploying, and managing enterprise-level Java applications.

Java EE is a collection of specifications, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and frameworks that define various aspects of enterprise application development. It includes technologies for building distributed, scalable, and secure applications. A Java EE server is responsible for implementing these specifications and providing the necessary infrastructure to run Java EE applications.

Key features and services provided by a Java EE server include:

1. Component Execution: Java EE servers execute various components of enterprise applications, such as servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), JavaServer Faces (JSF), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and more.

2. Distributed Computing: They support distributed computing features like clustering, load balancing, and distributed caching, allowing applications to be scaled across multiple servers.

3. Transaction Management: Java EE servers offer transaction management services, ensuring the integrity and consistency of data across multiple database operations.

4. Persistence: They provide support for the Java Persistence API (JPA), allowing applications to interact with databases using an object-relational mapping approach.

5. Messaging: Java EE servers support the Java Message Service (JMS) API, enabling applications to exchange messages asynchronously.

6. Security: They offer built-in security mechanisms and frameworks for authentication, authorization, and secure communication.

7. Resource Management: Java EE servers manage resources such as databases, connection pools, messaging systems, and more, providing a centralized and efficient way to access these resources.

8. Management and Monitoring: They provide tools and interfaces for managing, monitoring, and deploying applications in production environments.

Java EE servers are typically used for developing complex enterprise applications that require scalability, reliability, and advanced enterprise features. Examples of popular Java EE servers include Oracle WebLogic Server, IBM WebSphere Application Server, JBoss/WildFly, and Apache TomEE.

It's worth noting that the Java EE platform has evolved, and starting from Java EE 8, it has been rebranded as Jakarta EE under the Eclipse Foundation. Consequently, newer versions of application servers may be referred to as Jakarta EE servers rather than Java EE servers.

## Java servlet container

A Java servlet container, also known as a web container or servlet engine, is a software component that provides a runtime environment for executing Java servlets. It manages the lifecycle of servlets, handles incoming requests, and generates responses to those requests.

Here are the key aspects and functionalities of a Java servlet container:

1. Servlet Management: The servlet container is responsible for loading, initializing, and destroying servlets. It manages the lifecycle of servlets, ensuring that they are available to handle incoming requests.

2. Request Handling: When a client sends an HTTP request to a web application, the servlet container receives the request and determines which servlet should handle it. It maps the request to the appropriate servlet based on URL patterns or other configured mappings.

3. Thread Management: The servlet container manages a pool of threads to handle multiple concurrent requests. It ensures that servlet instances are properly handled and that requests are processed in a multithreaded environment.

4. Request Dispatching: After mapping a request to a servlet, the servlet container forwards the request to the corresponding servlet for processing. It provides the necessary context and objects (e.g., request and response objects) for the servlet to perform its tasks.

5. Response Generation: The servlet container receives the response generated by the servlet and sends it back to the client. It handles the communication with the client, including header management and data transmission.

6. Web Application Deployment: Servlet containers support the deployment of web applications, typically in the form of web archive (WAR) files. They provide a standardized structure for organizing servlets, JSP files, static resources, and configuration files. The container ensures that the deployed application is accessible and ready to handle requests.

7. Support for Servlet Specifications: Servlet containers implement the Java Servlet API specifications defined by the Java Community Process (JCP). They provide the necessary classes, interfaces, and runtime environment required by servlets to function correctly.

Examples of popular Java servlet containers include Apache Tomcat, Eclipse Jetty, and Undertow. They are lightweight and focused on serving servlets, making them suitable for small to medium-sized web applications.

## Java servlet container vs Enterprise application server

The choice between a servlet container and a Java EE server depends on the specific requirements and complexity of your application. Here are some factors to consider:

1. Application Complexity: Servlet containers are suitable for smaller applications that primarily require servlet execution and basic web functionality. If your application involves simple servlets, static content, and minimal enterprise features, a servlet container like Apache Tomcat or Eclipse Jetty would suffice.

2. Enterprise Features: If your application requires advanced enterprise features such as Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), Java Persistence API (JPA), Java Message Service (JMS), or JavaServer Faces (JSF), you should consider using a Java EE server. These servers provide a full implementation of the Java EE specifications and offer a wide range of additional services and APIs to support enterprise application development.

3. Scalability and Performance: Java EE servers are designed for large-scale enterprise applications that require high scalability and performance. They often include features like clustering, load balancing, and distributed caching to handle heavy workloads and ensure high availability. If your application needs to handle a significant number of concurrent users or requires scalability across multiple servers, a Java EE server would be more suitable.

4. Management and Monitoring: Java EE servers typically offer comprehensive management and monitoring tools for deploying, configuring, and monitoring applications in production environments. If you require advanced management capabilities or need to integrate with enterprise management systems, a Java EE server provides better support in these areas.

5. Compatibility and Interoperability: If your application needs to integrate with existing Java EE-based systems or frameworks, using a Java EE server ensures better compatibility and interoperability. Java EE servers adhere to the Java EE standards and provide a standardized environment, making it easier to work with other Java EE-based technologies.

6. Development Team Expertise: Consider the expertise and familiarity of your development team. If they have extensive experience with Java EE and are comfortable working with the Java EE platform and its specifications, using a Java EE server may be advantageous. However, if your team is more focused on servlet development and prefers a lightweight and simpler environment, a servlet container can be a suitable choice.

In summary, use a servlet container when your application is small-scale, requires basic servlet functionality, and doesn't have significant enterprise requirements. Choose a Java EE server when your application is larger, complex, and requires advanced enterprise features, scalability, management capabilities, and compatibility with other Java EE-based systems.

Note: Ensure that you have proper permissions to execute the scripts or commands, and make sure to adjust the commands accordingly if you have customized the Tomcat installation directory or the startup/shutdown scripts.

### Organization

Apache Tomcat follows a specific directory organization that helps organize its various components and configuration files. Here is an overview of the key directories in a typical Tomcat installation:

1. `bin`: This directory contains executable scripts and commands for managing the Tomcat server.

   - `catalina.sh` or `catalina.bat`: The main script used to start, stop, and manage the Tomcat server.
   - `startup.sh` or `startup.bat`: A convenience script to start the Tomcat server.
   - `shutdown.sh` or `shutdown.bat`: A convenience script to stop the Tomcat server.
   - Other scripts and commands for specific purposes like deploying applications, managing security, etc.

2. `conf`: This directory holds configuration files for Tomcat.

   - `server.xml`: The main configuration file for the Tomcat server, which defines the server's components, connectors, and other settings.
   - `web.xml`: The default configuration file for web applications, used to specify servlets, filters, listeners, and other settings.
   - `tomcat-users.xml`: The file used for configuring user accounts and roles for administrative access to Tomcat.
   - Other configuration files for specific features like security, logging, and database connectivity.

3. `lib`: This directory contains libraries (JAR files) required by Tomcat and its web applications.

   - `catalina.jar`: The core Tomcat library containing the implementation of the servlet container and other key components.
   - Other libraries required for specific features or functionality, such as database connectors, JSP tag libraries, etc.

4. `logs`: Tomcat generates log files in this directory.

   - `catalina.out`: The default log file capturing the standard output and error streams of the Tomcat server.
   - Other log files for each web application deployed on Tomcat, such as `localhost.<date>.log`, `manager.<date>.log`, etc.

5. `webapps`: This directory serves as the deployment location for web applications.

   - By default, each web application deployed on Tomcat is represented by a directory within the `webapps` directory.
   - The name of the directory corresponds to the context path of the web application.
   - Each web application may contain its own directory structure, including HTML, JSP, servlets, and other resources.

6. `work`: Tomcat uses this directory for storing compiled JSP pages and other temporary files generated during runtime.

   - Each deployed web application typically has a subdirectory within `work` where its compiled JSP pages and other temporary files are stored.

7. `temp`: This directory is used by Tomcat for temporary storage.

   - Tomcat may create additional subdirectories within `temp` for temporary file storage during application runtime.

These are the main directories in a standard Tomcat installation. The organization may vary slightly depending on the specific Tomcat version or any customizations made to the configuration.

### Gui Accounts

To create and manage roles and user accounts for the GUI (Graphical User Interface) in Apache Tomcat, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the `tomcat-users.xml` File: Locate the `tomcat-users.xml` file, which is typically located in the `conf` directory of your Tomcat installation. Open the file using a text editor.

2. Define Roles: Within the `<tomcat-users>` element, define the roles that you want to create. For example, you can add `<role>` elements like `<role rolename="admin"/>`, `<role rolename="manager-gui"/>`, etc., to specify different roles.

3. Create User Accounts: Add `<user>` elements within the `<tomcat-users>` element to create user accounts. Each `<user>` element should include attributes like `username`, `password`, and `roles` to assign roles to users. For example, `<user username="admin" password="admin123" roles="admin"/>`.

4. Hash Passwords (Optional): For improved security, it is recommended to hash the user passwords instead of storing them in plain text. You can use the `digest.sh` or `digest.bat` utility provided by Tomcat (located in the `bin` directory) to generate password hashes. Replace the plain text password in the `<user>` element with the generated hash.

5. Assign Roles to Users: Ensure that the `roles` attribute of each `<user>` element references the appropriate roles defined earlier. Multiple roles can be assigned to a user by separating them with commas. For example, `roles="admin,manager-gui"`.

6. Save the File: Save the `tomcat-users.xml` file after making the necessary changes.

7. Access the GUI with User Accounts: Restart Tomcat to apply the configuration changes. Once Tomcat is running, you can access the GUI (such as the Manager or Host Manager) using a web browser. Provide the username and password for the corresponding user account defined in the `tomcat-users.xml` file with the appropriate roles to log in.

8. Manage User Accounts and Roles: With a successful login, you can manage user accounts and roles through the GUI. The specific functionality available depends on the particular GUI application being used (e.g., Manager or Host Manager). You can add, modify, or remove user accounts, assign or revoke roles, and perform other administrative tasks as necessary.

Remember to secure the `tomcat-users.xml` file and other sensitive configuration files to prevent unauthorized access.

By following these steps, you can create and manage roles and user accounts for the GUI in Tomcat, controlling access and privileges for the various administrative functionalities provided by the GUI applications.

### Deploy war files

To deploy a WAR (Web Application Archive) file on Apache Tomcat, you can follow these steps:

1. Prepare your WAR File: Create or obtain the WAR file that contains your web application's compiled code, resources, and configuration files. Ensure that the WAR file is properly packaged and conforms to the Java EE or Servlet specifications.

2. Stop Tomcat (optional): If Tomcat is already running, you may choose to stop it before deploying the new WAR file. This step is optional, but it can prevent conflicts and ensure a clean deployment.

3. Locate the Deployment Directory: In your Tomcat installation directory, navigate to the "webapps" directory. This directory serves as the deployment location for web applications.

4. Deploy the WAR File: Copy the WAR file into the "webapps" directory. You can do this by simply pasting the file into the directory. Tomcat will automatically detect the presence of the WAR file and initiate the deployment process.

5. Verify Deployment: Once the WAR file is copied, Tomcat begins deploying the web application. It extracts the contents of the WAR file, initializes the application, and starts the necessary components. You can monitor the deployment process in the Tomcat logs, typically located in the "logs" directory.

6. Access the Deployed Application: Once the deployment is successful, you can access your application using the appropriate URL. The URL typically follows the pattern: `http://localhost:8080/application-name`, where "application-name" corresponds to the name of your deployed web application.

7. Redeploy or Undeploy: If you need to update or redeploy your application, you can repeat the deployment process by replacing the existing WAR file with a new version. Alternatively, to undeploy an application, you can delete the corresponding WAR file from the "webapps" directory. Tomcat will automatically remove the application and its associated files.

It's important to note that the deployment process may vary depending on your Tomcat version and configuration. Additionally, you may need to consider specific requirements, such as additional configuration files or external dependencies, depending on your web application.

Lastly, ensure that your web application is compatible with the version of Tomcat you are using and that any necessary dependencies or configurations are met to ensure a successful deployment.
